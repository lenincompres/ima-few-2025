# Part 1

## Introductions

Go over syllabus & class requirements. This is a contract between students + professor, so it is important we're all on the same page!

## Learning Goals

* Why am I in this class? Why NOW?
* What do I hope I will learn? What are my goals?
* What content do I think will help me accomplish my learning goals?

## Lecture: What is Web Development?

## In class assignment

Work with a partner and create an HTML page in the P5 editor that includes:

* A DOCTYPE tag
* An html tag
* A head
  * Include a title and meta tag for the viewport
* A body
  * In the body, add a large heading that acts as a headline that declares your favorite restaurant
  * Below this large heading, add a smaller sub-heading that tells the user a bold statement about this restaurant
  * Include sensational paragraph text that tells a fictional 3-4 sentence story about this restaurant.
  * Add a ridiculous image of a food item that this restaurant sells. Note, you will need to find an image on the internet and link to its URL.
  * Somewhere on the page, include a link to an external website. Make sure that link opens in a new tab or window. Bonus: Embed that link in the image.
  * Before you leave, make sure both students have a link to the codepen to revisit it after class

# Homework  

### 1. Get inspired  
- Find *something that excites you* about front-end development:  
  - A creative portfolio  
  - An interactive experience  
  - A beautifully polished website  
- Prepare a **2–3 min presentation** for next class:  
  - What did you find?  
  - Who made it (do a little digging)?  
  - Why does it inspire you?  

### 2. Set up your GitHub repo  
- Create a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) called **Front-End Web**.  
- Share the link on GChat or in our Google Space.  
- Make the repo **public**.  
- Activate **Wikis** in the repo settings.  
- Write your first **Learning Log** in the wiki:  
  - Reflect on the introductory concepts of HTML and CSS.  
  - This is about *perception, not perfection.*  
  - **Suggested resources** (choose a couple — they cover the same basics):  
    - [Khan Academy – Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Webpages](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css)  
    - [Codecademy – Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website)

    - [Don’t Fear The Internet – Basic HTML & CSS](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/)  
    - [Don’t Fear The Internet – Internet Basics](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/)  
    - [Mozilla – Intro to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)  
    - [Mozilla – Getting Started with CSS (Parts 1–14)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps)  
    - [25 HTML and CSS Tutorials on Codeburst](https://codeburst.io/25-html-css-tutorials-d35caaa9430d)  

### 3. Set up your dev environment  
- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
- Create a project with a file named **index.html**:  
  - Copy your class code into this file.  
  - Add a **nav bar** for your restaurant page (it can just be a bulleted list for now — we’ll style it next week with CSS).   

### 4. Set up GitHub Desktop  
- Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).  
- Link it to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
