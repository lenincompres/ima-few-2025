# Final Project workshop

## Topic:

* [DOM.js](https://github.com/lenincompres/DOM.js) Binders

## Activities:

Projects presentations. Please share any issues, challenges and breakthroughs on your final project's journey.

## Peer Walkthroughs: Narrative Flow Test
Break into pairs or trios.
Each student gets 5 minutes to present + 3 minutes to receive structured feedback, answering:
* What story is being told?
* What part felt unclear or abrupt?
* What interaction felt meaningful?
* Where do I expect a response or transition?
* Students take notes after each critique.

## Production Sprint (45 minutes)
Students work individually on:
* Fixing clarity issues
* Improving interactive pacing
* Refining typographic hierarchy
* Implementing one new narrative-focused interaction
* Cleaning code / structure

## Rapid User Testing
Rotate groups of 3:
Round format
* 2 minutes silent exploration
* 1 minute giving impressions
* “I understood…”
* “I was confused when…”
* “I wanted to click or scroll here…”
* “This moment felt strong because…”
